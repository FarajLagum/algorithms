def containsDuplicate(nums):
    '''
    This function works by first sorting the input list `nums`. 
    Then it iterates through the sorted list, comparing each element to the one before it. 
    If it finds two adjacent elements that are equal, it returns `True`. 
    If it gets through the entire list without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

    nums.sort()
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            return True

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is $$O(n \log n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of `nums`. 
This is because the time complexity of sorting is $$O(n \log n)$$, and 
we then do a single pass through the sorted list, which is $$O(n)$$. 
Since $$O(n \log n)$$ dominates $$O(n)$$, the overall time complexity is $$O(n \log n)$$.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is $$O(1)$$, 
because we only use a constant amount of space to store the input list and a few variables. 
We are sorting the list in-place, so we do not use any additional space proportional to the size of the input. 

**Note** that this analysis assumes that the sort operation can be done in-place with $$O(1)$$ space. 
If the Python interpreter does not support this, the space complexity would be $$O(n)$$.
