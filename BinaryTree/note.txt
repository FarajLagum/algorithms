# Binary Tree

- A Binary tree is a tree wher every node has at most two children.
- Binary tree has exactly 1 root.
- There is exactly one path between root and any node.
- No cycles.
- empty tree is a binary tree.
- a node is represented as a class instance.
- Chideren are defined in terms of the partent node as left child and right child 


                    (node.left) <--- (node)  ---> (node.right) 



 

# Binary Tree terms
- root node
- leaf node
- partent node
- child node
