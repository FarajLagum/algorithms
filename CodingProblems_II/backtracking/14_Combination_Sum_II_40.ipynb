    "# The complexity of backtracking in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The time complexity**: The time complexity of backtracking algorithms is often hard to calculate and can vary greatly depending on the specific problem, the constraints, and the input data. However, in the worst-case scenario, backtracking algorithms can have a time complexity of `O(N!)` or even `O(N^N)`, where `N` is the size of the input. This is because **backtracking is an exhaustive search** technique and in the worst case, it might end up exploring all possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The space complexity** of backtracking algorithms is usually O(N), as they generally require storing a stack of up to N recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual time and space complexity can be much better if the problem has additional properties that the algorithm can take advantage of, or much worse if the problem requires exploring a large number of possibilities. For example, if a **solution can be found without exploring all possibilities**, or if the algorithm can effectively **prune branches of the search space**, the actual time complexity can be significantly less than the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking can be computationally expensive, but it's a powerful technique that can solve complex problems that are hard to solve with other methods. It's particularly effective for solving constraint satisfaction problems, where you need to find a solution that meets a set of constraints. "
