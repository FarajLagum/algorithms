# Backtrcking 

•	Backtracking is a problem-solving strategy that uses a brute-force approach.
•	The brute-force approach implies trying out all possible solutions for a given problem and selecting the desired solutions.
•	Backtracking is different from dynamic programming, as it is not specifically for optimization problems.
•	Backtracking is used when a problem has multiple solutions, and the goal is to find all of those solutions.
•	Backtracking involves constructing a solution tree or state space tree to represent and explore all possible arrangements or combinations.
•	Constraints can be imposed during backtracking, and nodes that violate these constraints are pruned or "killed" using bounding functions.
•	Backtracking follows a depth-first search (DFS) approach in generating the solution tree, exploring one branch fully before backtracking.
